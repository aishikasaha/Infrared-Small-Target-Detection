# Infrared-Small-Target-Detection
Efficient detection of targets immersed in a complex
background with a low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) is very
important in infrared search and tracking (IRST) applications.
In this paper, we address the target detection problem in terms
of local image segmentation and propose a novel small target
detection algorithm derived from facet kernel and random
walker (RW) algorithm which includes four main stages. First,
since the RW algorithm is suitable for images with less noises,
local order-statistic and mean filtering are applied to remove
the pixel-sized noises with high brightness (PNHB) and smooth
the infrared images. Second, the infrared image is filtered by
the facet kernel to enhance the target pixels and candidate
target pixels are extracted by an adaptive threshold operation.<br>
<h2>THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION CHOSEN:<br></h2>
ROBUST target detection is a key technique in infrared search and tracking (IRST) applications, such as infrared precise guidance and early warning for Aerial surveillance.<br>
<h2>IMAGE ENHANCEMENT METHOD SELECTED:<br></h2>
Random Walker algorithm. Since it is suitable for images with less noises, local order-statistic and mean filtering are applied to remove the pixel-sized noises with high brightness (PNHB) and smooth the infrared images.<br>
